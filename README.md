Setting up a new laptop/desktop/server/docker? These dot files make it easy breasy! It's set up to work with both __Macs__ and __Debian__ based distributions. All you need to do is...

## Quickstart

__Mac only__: install homebrew:

`/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"`

Then, make sure to install `curl`:

`apt-get update && apt-get install curl`

or 

`brew install curl`

followed by:

`/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lookingfortrees/dotfiles/master/install.sh)"`

Start `$ zsh` and you're good to go!
